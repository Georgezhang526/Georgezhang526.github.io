I am a senior student, majoring in Material Science and Engineering at New Energy Materials and Devices specialty class, [Shenzhen University](https://cmse.szu.edu.cn/ywz/). 

At present, I have been recommended for further study at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), National Excellent Engineer College in Professor Deng Yonghong's research group.

My research direction is secondary batteries, mainly researching electrolyte mechanisms. At the same time, I am deeply interested in quantum chemistry, hoping to make theoretical calculations one of my development directions.

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
